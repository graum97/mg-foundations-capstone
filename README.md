MyBrary is a web application created by Mara Grau. She set out to create simple way for people to keep track of books they've read and books they want to read. This repository is the result of a week and a half of work, and pulls data from a db.json file. In the future, Mara hopes to implement postgreSQL for the database, and allow different users to save personalized data.
